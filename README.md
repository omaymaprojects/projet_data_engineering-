## Overview

The **Projet Data Engineering** aims to demonstrate the implementation of a robust data processing pipeline. It covers data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and storage, providing a foundation for building data-driven applications and performing advanced analytics.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion:** Efficiently collect data from various sources.
- **Data Processing:** Clean and transform raw data into usable formats.
- **Scalability:** Handle large datasets with ease using optimized processes.
- **Dockerization:** Containerized application for easy deployment and environment consistency.
- **Modular Design:** Organized codebase facilitating easy maintenance and extension.
- **Experimentation:** Dedicated workspace for testing and validating new ideas and approaches.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (optional, for Docker setup)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omaymaprojects/projet_data_engineering-.git
   cd projet_data_engineering-
   
2.Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

3.Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
To run the data pipeline, execute:

bash
Copier le code
python main.py
Note: Ensure that all necessary configuration parameters (like data source paths, database credentials, etc.) are correctly set within the main.py script or through environment variables.

Experiments
The experiments directory contains various notebooks and scripts for testing new features or processing methods. To run these experiments:

Navigate to the experiments directory:

bash
Copier le code
cd experiments
Run Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copier le code
jupyter notebook
Open and run the desired notebook in your web browser to test and visualize results.

Docker Setup
To containerize and run the application using Docker:

Build the Docker image:

bash
Copier le code
docker build -t projet_data_engineering .
Run the Docker container:

bash
Copier le code
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 projet_data_engineering
Access the application:

The application should now be running and accessible at http://localhost:8000.

Note: Adjust the exposed ports and other Docker settings as needed in the dockerfile.
